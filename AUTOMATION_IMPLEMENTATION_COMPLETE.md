## Grid Layout

### Perfect Symmetry Maintained

howItHelps: 'Saves 60% of email handling time by auto-sorting emails and using smart templates for FAQs, booking confirmations, and standard replies'

realWorld: 'Properties report handling 3x more emails with the same staff by using email automation with smart filters and templates'
