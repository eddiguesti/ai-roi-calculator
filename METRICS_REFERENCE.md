## Understanding the Three Types

### 🕒 Time-Saving (Type: 'time')
- **What**: Reduces staff hours spent on tasks
- **Calculation**: Applied to current labor hours × hourly rate
- **Benefit**: Lower operational costs, staff freed for guest service
- **Example**: 85% email sorting automation = 85% less time sorting emails

### 💰 Revenue-Increasing (Type: 'revenue')
- **What**: Generates additional income through optimization
- **Calculation**: Applied to estimated annual revenue
- **Benefit**: Higher RevPAR, occupancy, or revenue per transaction
- **Example**: 19% dynamic pricing boost = 19% more revenue from same occupancy

### 🎯 Conversion-Boosting (Type: 'conversion')
- **What**: Increases booking completion rates
- **Calculation**: Applied to estimated revenue from improved conversions
- **Benefit**: More direct bookings, reduced cart abandonment
- **Example**: 28% booking assistant boost = 28% more inquiries converted

## Conservative Revenue Estimation

The calculator uses a **5:1 revenue-to-cost ratio** for estimation:
- If property spends **£30,000/year** on admin → Estimated **£150,000** annual revenue
- If property spends **£50,000/year** on admin → Estimated **£250,000** annual revenue

This is conservative. Typical hospitality ratios range from 5:1 to 10:1.

## How to Present These Numbers

### ✅ DO:
- "Our AI handles 80% of routine inquiries, based on industry benchmarks"
- "Dynamic pricing typically increases RevPAR by 7-35%, with an average of 19%"
- "Hotels see 20-40% more direct bookings with 24/7 AI assistants"

### ❌ DON'T:
- "We'll save you 95% on everything"
- "Dynamic pricing provides 95% savings" (it's revenue, not savings!)
- Promise exact results without qualifiers

### 💡 BEST PRACTICE:
Always cite the source:
- "In a study of 36 hotels, Lighthouse Pricing Manager showed 19.25% RevPAR increase over 5 months"
- "Industry leaders achieve 85-92% inquiry automation"
- "PMS integration studies show 70-90% reduction in reconciliation time"

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is dynamic pricing only 19% when it used to be 95%?**
A: The old 95% was mislabeled as "savings" when it should have been revenue increase. Real studies show 7-35% RevPAR increases, with 19% being the average.

**Q: Are these percentages guaranteed?**
A: No. These are based on industry studies and benchmarks. Actual results vary by property, implementation quality, and market conditions.

**Q: Can we use higher percentages if we implement really well?**
A: The calculator shows averages. Top performers see higher results (e.g., 35% RevPAR for dynamic pricing), but it's more honest to show typical results.

**Q: What if someone challenges our numbers?**
A: Every metric is backed by published research. See IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md for full source list.
